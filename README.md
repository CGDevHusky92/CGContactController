CGContactController
===================

This is just an initial commit of what will become my Contact Search controller that can search through the contacts, parse out names and phone numbers. I am using this to currently go through and search a parse database for the given contacts. I will be making this more modal based so that it can plug and play searching any given source connected through the CGSyncController (possibly a CGConnectController).
